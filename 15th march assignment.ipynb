    "human intelligence, such as speech recognition, problem-solving, decision-making, and language translation.\n",
    "AI can be categorized into two types: narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI is designed to perform specific tasks,\n",

    "Example: A common example of artificial intelligence is virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa. These virtual\n",
